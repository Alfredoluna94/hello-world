# hello-world
My first repository

My name is Alfredo Bernal Luna.
I studied a bachelorÂ´s degree in Superior School of Physics and Mathematics at National Polythecnique Institute.
I love to listen to music and play songs on my guitar, read poetry and study maths.
My dream is to study maths in a proffesional way and do research for the benefit of all of us humans.
